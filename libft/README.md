# Libft
### The aim of the first part: 
To re-code a set of the libc functions, as defined in their man. Our functions will need to present the same prototype and behaviors as the originals.
### The aim of the second part:
To code a set of functions that are either not included in the libc, or included in a different form.
### The aim of the bonus part:
To code a set of functions that will allow our to easily use our lists.
